Bootstrap Debian
================
Installs the minimum requirements for using Ansible on Debian/Ubuntu hosts.

The role installs the `python`, `python-apt` and `python-pycurl` packages
if they were not already available. After the first run, this role will do
nothing. A typical use case would be scripted setup of new hosts.

See the [GitHub repository](http://github.com/cederberg/ansible-bootstrap-debian)
for detailed script and source code.
